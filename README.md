# Milestone 1 - The Monkees

My First Milestone Project

This project is the first of my Milestone projects while studying Full Stack Software Development with Code Institute. I have been tasked with creating a website which is responsive and appeals to the target audience of the popular band The Monkees. 

I have used bright colours which are associated with The Monkees and the era in which they are prominent. I have used fun fonts which match the vibe that the band exudes. I have included a page containing the bands media, such as photos, videos and audio clips. Their tour information is included on a separate page. I also have a Meet the Band page, in which each member of the band has a short bio. On the homepage I have included some information about the band as a whole and a contact form for use in booking the band for gigs.



# UX

With this website, The Monkees hoped to promote their band and music. They wanted the site to look attractive to their main fanbase. They wanted to showcase their music and photos. They also wanted to show that they are available for gigs such as weddings. Using the guidelines they have provided I was able to assist in each area of their request. The pages are separated to ensure an easier user experience and better navigation.

My wireframes were made using Balsamiq.
